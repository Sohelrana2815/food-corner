**AOS Animation:**  Smooth animations for an engaging user experience.



# How It Works
1. Adding Recipes:

- Click the Want to Cook button on a food item card to add it to the "Want to Cook" table.

2. Moving to Currently Cooking:

- Click the Preparing button in the "Want to Cook" table to move the recipe to the "Currently Cooking" table.

- The recipe is removed from the "Want to Cook" table, and the count decreases accordingly.

3. Tracking Progress:

- The "Currently Cooking" table dynamically updates the total time and total calories as recipes are added.


## Responsive Design

- Desktop Layout: Cards and tables are displayed side by side for better visual hierarchy.

- Mobile Layout: The "Currently Cooking" table is displayed above the cards to ensure a seamless experience.
